# CMP309: Software Development for Mobile Devices

### Assessment - Mobile Application

> In this coursework, you will demonstrate your ability to design, develop and critically evaluate a 
mobile application for Android OS.

##### 1. Guidelines

> Design and develop a coherent and user-friendly Android application that uses GUI elements, data 
storage and connectivity features discussed in the module and based on your own research. This
application must be written in Java or Kotlin (NOT C++). It must demonstrate ALL the following:
> * Principles of Object-Oriented programming and adherence to an appropriate app architecture model 
and software development practices.
> * At least 2 application components and communication between them.
>   - Acceptable components are Activities, Services, Broadcast Receivers, Content Providers and App
Widgets.
> * At least 3 unique screens/pages and utilising different layouts, views and UI widgets.
>   - These can be implemented using Activities, Fragments, Tabs, Navigation Drawer or Popup Dialogs.
> * Appropriate handling of application lifecycle and user input.
>  - Consider lifecycle callback functions, orientation handling and data persistence.
> * At least one example of each: data storage AND connectivity.
>   - For data storage you can use Local File Storage, SQLite Databases, Cloud Storage or Shared
Preferences (if used extensively).
>   - Connectivity features include Location, Telephony, Messaging, Google Cloud Services, Bluetooth,
Sockets, NFC, Web App Integration and HTTP communication with 3rd APIs (if handled using native
Android/Google API).
> * Consideration of application usability, security, performance and resource management.
>   - Consider appropriate use of threads (where needed), app permissions, network status monitoring
and management, file sizes, data usage, authentication and effect of the app on battery life.
>   - You can also research and implement appropriate app accessibility features such as alternative
themes, localisation, voice assistant, etc.

> If youâ€™d like to use a feature not listed above, please discuss it with the module tutor. Extra
credit will be given for correct implementation of features not explicitly covered in class.

> Your application must run on an Android device or emulator. It is highly recommended that you
use API level 29 or Higher. If you would like to use an older device running older version of
Android, please discuss this with the module tutor. You may use external libraries, provided these
are used only for graphics, calculations or data processing and do not prevent you from
demonstrating the understanding of core principles of mobile application development. If in doubt,
consult the module tutor.
